# Udacity Feed Reader Testing Project

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Development course. In it I was tasked with writing a series of unit tests for the Jasmine testing suite to ensure that the feed reader was performing as expected in various situations.

## How to view this project

Feel free to either download the zip, fork, or clone this project. To view the results of the various unit tests, open the index.html file in your browser of choice and scroll to the bottom. And, of course, feel free to modify the app.js in the js folder to see what happens when the passing conditions for the various unit tests are not met.

## What I learned

Much like version control, once you get over the initial learning curve, unit testing allows you to refactor and play with your code with more confidence knowing that your unit tests will catch a change that breaks some fundamental functionality with your code. While in this project I was tasked with writing unit tests for code that had already been written, I can also see how writing the unit tests **first** could assist in organizing my thoughts before actually working on an application's code.
